# NYC-housing-rental-predections
We predicted housing rentals in NYC as well as predicted the longitude and latitude for confidential buildings in  New York City. 

We have used Python, pandas and Matplotlib for this project.

At first we did the cleaning procedure for our database which included cleaning, clustering, dealing with missing values as well as outliers and so on.
